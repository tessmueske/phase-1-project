~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an interactive and informative info sheet on some of the Mediterranean countries! It includes a wealth of basic info such as languages spoken, religions practiced, the country's capital, its population, as well as other additional facts. 

There is a dropdown feature that allows users to filter by population less than 10 million, whether French is spoken, and independece year of 1956.

Thank you for interacting with my project! :D
